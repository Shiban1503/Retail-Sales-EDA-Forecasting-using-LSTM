# Retail Sales | EDA | Forecasting using LSTM
**Purpose**

This project aims to analyze and predict key sales metrics by leveraging historical sales, store, and macroeconomic data. By employing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and advanced machine learning (specifically LSTM models), we provide actionable insights into weekly sales trends, store performance, and the impact of external factors like fuel prices, temperature, and holidays. The findings are intended to support inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts.

**Dataset Overview**

The analysis is based on three datasets:

Features Data Set: Contains store-specific details, such as fuel price, CPI, and markdown information.

Sales Data Set: Includes weekly sales information for each store and department.

Stores Data Set: Provides metadata on store types and sizes.

These datasets are merged into a single comprehensive dataset for analysis.

**Steps and Implementation**

1. Data Preprocessing

Imported essential libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
Uploaded datasets and examined data structures, missing values, and distributions.
Converted date columns into datetime format and split them into Year, Month, and Day columns for better temporal analysis.
Merged datasets into a single DataFrame and filled missing values with 0.
Saved the preprocessed dataset as processed_data.csv.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA focused on uncovering trends and patterns in the data:

  **Fuel Price Analysis:**
  - Observed fluctuations over three years.
  - Examined variations by store type during holidays.

  **Temperature Analysis:**
  - Rounded temperature into ranges for better visualization.
  - Analyzed its relationship with fuel prices and CPI.

  **Weekly Sales Analysis:**
  - Studied weekly sales trends across three years.
  - Compared holiday vs non-holiday sales through hypothesis testing.
  
  **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Identified relationships between key variables using a heatmap.

  **Store Performance:**
  - Ranked stores based on total weekly sales.
  - Highlighted top-performing stores.

  **Visualizations:**
  - Created various plots (line, bar, scatter) to explain the data.
  - Saved plots with unique filenames for easy referencing.

3. Machine Learning - LSTM for Sales Prediction
   
  **Feature Engineering**
  - Selected relevant features such as temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment rate, markdowns, and holiday indicators.
  - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Store Type) using label encoding.
  - Scaled features and target variables using MinMaxScaler.

  **Sequence Preparation**
  - Designed sequences for time-series data to feed into the LSTM model.

  **Model Architecture**
  - Built an LSTM model with 3 layers and dropout to prevent overfitting.
  - Optimized the model using Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function.

  **Training and Evaluation**
  - Trained the model on 80% of the data and validated it on the remaining 20%.
  - Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error     (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).
  - Visualized actual vs predicted sales and training history for deeper insights.

**RESULTS**

**Statistical Insights**

Holiday Impact on Sales:
- A hypothesis test revealed statistically significant differences in weekly sales between holidays and non-holidays.
- T-statistic and p-value confirmed the impact of holidays on sales performance.

Store Rankings:
- Identified the top 3 performing stores based on total sales.

Feature Correlation:
- Weekly sales had notable correlations with fuel prices and CPI.

**Model Performance**

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Low error indicates reliable predictions.
- R2 Score: High R2 value demonstrates strong model performance.

**Model Performance Metrics**

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: `13894.375303761786`  
  The mean absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, representing the average error magnitude.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `459417153.5329345`  
  The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values, which penalizes larger errors more heavily.

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: `21434.018604380617`  
  The square root of the mean squared error, providing the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors).

- **R-Squared (RÂ²) Score**: `0.12613910410230456`  
  The coefficient of determination indicates how well the model's predictions fit the data. A value of 1 signifies a perfect fit, while 0 means no fit at all.

**Sales Analysis**

- **Total Sales During Holidays**: `505,299,551.56`  
  The total sales recorded during holiday periods.

- **Total Sales During Non-Holidays**: `6,231,919,435.55`  
  The total sales recorded during non-holiday periods.

- **Sales Difference (Holidays vs Non-Holidays)**: `-5,726,619,883.99`  
  The difference in total sales between holiday and non-holiday periods, showing significantly higher sales during non-holiday times.

**Final Insights**:
- **Non-holiday periods** are significant for sales, with far greater sales volume than holiday periods.  
- Businesses should focus their marketing efforts, promotions, and incentives during non-holiday weeks to capitalize on this trend and boost overall sales.
  
**Conclusion**

This project provides a robust framework for analyzing and predicting retail sales data. By integrating statistical analysis, machine learning, and strategic insights, it equips stakeholders with actionable recommendations for improving store performance, optimizing inventory, and refining marketing strategies.
