# Retail-Sales-EDA-Forecasting-using-LSTM
Purpose

This project aims to analyze and predict key sales metrics by leveraging historical sales, store, and macroeconomic data. By employing techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and advanced machine learning (specifically LSTM models), we provide actionable insights into weekly sales trends, store performance, and the impact of external factors like fuel prices, temperature, and holidays. The findings are intended to support inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts.
